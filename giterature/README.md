* Rapid iterations (with giterate or other similar tool)
* Radical openness
* Open source tools only
* Markdown editor is enough (no fancy word processors needed)
* Text organized using directory structure (e.g. /novel/chapter_about_fishes/README.md)
* No horizontal links, only vertical
* Use reddit to upvote/downvote projects, chapters, plotlines etc.
